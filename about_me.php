    <p id="aboutme"> I know what your thinking, "What an amazing mountain biker<br>
                    this dude is!" Sadly, that image is not me. I don't know who<br>
                    it is...and yes that is an amazing jump. If it <em>was</em> me, the <br>
                    the next image would would be an ambulance.<br><br>
                    
                    But enough about that person, let's talk about me. My name<br>
                    is Allen Wipf. I created this website for a class at Omaha<br>
                    Code School. I'm pretty excited about learning this stuff <br>
                    and while I think that jump is pretty cool, I think<br>
                    learning to code is even cooler.
